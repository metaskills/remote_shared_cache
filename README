This class implements the strategy for deployment which uses a remote shared cache that is assumed to be 
accessible by each target host. The remote cache is a SCM export created in one of the following two ways.

  1) If :remote_repository_access is not set or is false, a local export is made, compressed
     and copied to the target host and uncompressed to the remote shared cache.
  2) If :remote_repository_access returns true, the target host will perform a direct SCM 
     export to the remote shared cache.

Despite which method is used above, the creation of the remote shared cache will only target the primary 
app server using the primary_app_server() method. Again all other app targets assume that this is a 
shared directory accessbile to all. This yeilds faster deployments since capistrano does not have to 
locally prepare/compress/copy the source to each host.

This development strategy inherets from the normal Copy deployment strategy and uses many of the same 
metods/configurations available to that class when needing to perform local export and copy of the source.
Examples include, :copy_compression, :copy_remote_dir, :copy_dir. Configurations specific to this strategy 
includes, :shared_cache_dir (parent of all cached revisions) and :remote_repository_access (which determins 
what method is used above to create the shared cache).
